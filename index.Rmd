# Preface

Predictive Modeling is a type of Machine Learning which itself is a sub branch of Artificial Intelligence. The [following graphic](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/07/29/whats-difference-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-ai/
) provides us with some history of these domains. This is helpful if you are trying to orient yourself in the world of analytics and machine learning. Note that AI has been around for quite some time. The Wikipedia definition of AI is:

> The study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes 
> actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning relies upon "patterns and inference"" to "perform a specific task without using explicit instructions". It is a form of Applied AI that attempts to automatically learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. Think of Predictive Modeling as a subset of this which falls into two categories:

**Supervised**

Algorithms that build a model on a set of data containing both the inputs and the desired outputs (“labels” or known numeric values). When you want to map input to known output labels. Build a model that, when applied to “new” data, will hopefully predict the correct label.

Some common techniques for Supervised learning include: Generalized Linear Models (GLM),
Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and K Nearest Neighbors. 


**Unsupervised**

Algorithms that take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data (e.g. clustering of data points)

Some common techniques for unsupervised learning include: hierarchical clustering, k-means
clustering, mixture models, DBSCAN, Association Rules, Neural Networks

## Predictive Modeling

This lecture is concerned primarily with Predictive Modeling. Some examples of Predictive Modeling include:

  * Predict current CD4 cell count of an HIV-positive patient using genome sequences

  * Predict Success of Grant Applications

  * Use attributes of chemical compounds to predict likelihood of hepatic injury

  * How many copies of a new book will sell ?

  * Will a customer change Internet Service Providers ? 

In this domain there are generally two types of predictive models.

## In-Sample vs Out-Of-Sample Error

The goal of predictive model is to generate models that can generalize to new data. It would be good if any model we generate could provide a good estimate of out of sample error. It's easy to generate a model on an entire data set (in sample data) and then turn around and use that data for prediction. But how will it perform on new data ? Haven't we just over trained our model ? 

## Performance Metrics

For either case (regression vs classification) we need some type of metric or measure to let us know how well a given model will work on new or unseen data - also known as "out of sample" data. for Classification problems we look at things like "sensitivity", "specificity", "accuracy", and "Area Under Curve". 

For Quantitative outcomes, we look at things like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Here is the formula for Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). P represents a vector of predictions and O represents a vector of the observed (true) values.

\[
RMSE = \sqrt\frac{\sum_i^n(P_i-O_i)^2}{n}
\]

## Black Box

The **good news** is that you can treat building predictive models as a "Black Box". The **bad news** is that you can treat building predictive models as a "Black Box".

It's better to get up and running with building some models than it is to sit back and read how to do it. The process of assessing models and diagnosing them can be an in depth process thus I don't wish to understate what it takes to do that. However, moving forward with some of the basic mechanics and concepts is good. One can always work with the individual methods or go to Section 6 to start with caret. The larger message is to get busy getting your hands dirty.
